    "This notebook demonstrates calculations of the amount of material needed in electrochemical reactions in the global energy transition under stated assumptions. All the necessary references are included in the text of the notebook. Three cases are investegated as examples: Platinum on the cathode of PEM electrolyzesr, iridium on the anode of PEM electrolyzers, and platinum on the cathode of PEM fuel cells. The case of platinum in PEM electrolyzer cathodes is worked, whereas platinum for fuel cells and iridium for PEM electrolyzer anodes are left as guided problems for the students. In all cases, the predicted precious metal demand is an upper limit, as in reality PEM electrolyzers compete with alkaline and solid oxide, and PEM fuel cells compete with battery electrification. The ipython notebook format used here offers the advantage of transparency and enables useful parts to be copied and adapted to solve similar problems. \n",
